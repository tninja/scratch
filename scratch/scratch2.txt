I use spacemacs, and add this to my config file:

(use-package aider
  :config
  ;; GEMINI model
  (setq aider-args '("--model" "gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25"))
  (setenv "GEMINI_API_KEY" "my-api-key")
  ;; Optional: Set a key binding for the transient menu
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c a") 'aider-transient-menu)
  )

I installed aider and from terminal all works but when I try the same command (/ask) from within emacs using aieder.el, I get this error:

litellm.APIConnectionError: No module named 'google'

You need to: pip install google-generativeai

The model I use is gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25

The error msg said it require: pip install google-generativeai.

I see similar issue before. Seems that gemini model required additional python library.

BTW. Aider use gemini-exp alias for gemini/gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25: https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider/blob/main/HISTORY.md#aider-v0811

Hmm I am wondering if they are using same python.. maybe emacs started a
different Python installation which don’t have library installed.

Would you mind try aider inside emacs eshell and see how it does, so that we know if aider in emacs works?

Tried aieder from within emacs using both eshell and v term and the same /ask command. Both works well as in gnome terminal with no errors.

In aider.el, aider process started with this line: https://github.com/tninja/aider.el/blob/main/aider-core.el#L236. LLM said it won't include things inside .bashrc or .zshrc. Is there special PATH or PYTHONPATH variable setting there about library or uv? If there is, LLM suggest to set them in emacs, for example:


(setenv "PATH" (concat "/home/r/.local/share/uv/tools/aider-chat/bin:" (getenv "PATH")))
(setenv "PYTHONPATH" "/home/r/.local/share/uv/tools/aider-chat/lib/python3.12/site-packages")

BTW, I do confirmed that gemini-exp works well on my laptop.

I do not have any special PATH, but I still try to add the ones you suggest me, but I still get the error
