**** 创-Gen 1

Gen 1:1 "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

起初　神创造天地。

Gen 1:2 "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the
face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of
the waters."

地是空虚混沌，渊面黑暗；　神的灵运行在水面上。

Gen 1:3 "And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light."

神说：“要有光。”就有了光。

Gen 1:4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light
from the darkness.

神看光是好的，就把光暗分开了。

Gen 1:5 "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
there was evening and there was morning, the first day."

神称光为“昼”，称暗为“夜”。有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。
